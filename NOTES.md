Basic language features in c

operators
------------------

 - arithmetic + - * / % ++ --
 - relational == != < > <= >=
 - bitwise ~ & | ^ >> <<
 - logical && || !
 - conditional ?:
 - assignment = += -+ *= /= %=

operator characteristics
----------------------------
 - arity (unary,binary, ternary)
 - precedence
 - associativity: order in which orperators of the same predecence execute
    
expressions, statements, blocks
------------
 - expression: sequence of operators that resolves to a single value
 - statement: expression terminated by a semi-colon
 - block: sequence of statements between a pair of matches braces { }
 - scope: part of the program where a variable can be used:
    - local: inside a block
    - global: outside blocks

control structures, data structures:
---------
- conditional - if/else
- selective - switch statement
- iterative - for, while, do-while (segfaults often)
- jump - break, continue
